          <h1>BENGAL TIGER</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify col-xs-12">
          <p>The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies. By 2011, the total
            population
            was estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend. None of the 'Tiger Conservation
            Landscapes' within the Bengal tiger's range is considered large enough to support an effective population
            size of 250 adult individuals. Since 2010, it is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. By 2010,
            Bengal tiger populations in India were estimated at 1,706–1,909. As of 2016, they had reputedly increased
            to an estimated 3,890 individuals. Bengal tigers number around 440 in Bangladesh and 163–253 in Nepal.
            Prior censuses placed the tiger population in Bhutan at around 65–75 individuals. In 2015, it was estimated
            that 103 Bengal tigers were living in the country. Bengal is traditionally fixed as the typical locality
            for the binomen Panthera tigris, to which the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the
            Bengal tiger in 1929 under the trinomen Panthera tigris tigris. The Bengal, Caspian and Siberian tigers,
            and lion rank among the biggest cats. It is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.</p>

          <h3>Characteristics</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify col-xs-12">
          <p>The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly
            and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings. The white tiger
            is a recessive mutant of the Bengal tiger, which is reported in the wild from time to time in Assam,
            Bengal, Bihar and especially from the former State of Rewa. However, it is not to be mistaken as an
            occurrence
            of albinism. In fact, there is only one fully authenticated case of a true albino tiger, and none of
            black tigers, with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify col-xs-12">
          <p>Male Bengal tigers have an average total length of 270 to 310 cm (110 to 120 in) including the tail, while
            females measure 240 to 265 cm (94 to 104 in) on average. The tail is typically 85 to 110 cm (33 to 43
            in) long, and on average, tigers are 90 to 110 cm (35 to 43 in) in height at the shoulders. The weight
            of males ranges from 180 to 258 kg (397 to 569 lb), while that of the females ranges from 100 to 160
            kg (220 to 350 lb). The smallest recorded weights for Bengal tigers are from the Bangladesh Sundarbans,
            where adult females are 75 to 80 kg (165 to 176 lb). Bengal tigers have exceptionally stout teeth, and
            the canines are the longest among all living felids; measuring from 7.5 to 10 cm (3.0 to 3.9 in) in length.

          <h3>Genetic ancestry</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify col-xs-12">
          <p>Bengal tigers are defined by three distinct mitochondrial nucleotide sites and 12 unique microsatellite
            alleles.
            The pattern of genetic variation in the Bengal tiger corresponds to the premise that they arrived in
            India approximately 12,000 years ago. This is consistent with the lack of tiger fossils from the Indian
            subcontinent prior to the late Pleistocene and the absence of tigers from Sri Lanka, which was separated
            from the subcontinent by rising sea levels in the early Holocene.</p>

          <h3>Body weight</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify col-xs-12">
          <p>Bengal tigers may weigh up to 325 kg (717 lb) and reach a head and body length of 320 cm (130 in). Several
            scientists indicated that adult male Bengal tigers from Nepal, Bhutan, and Assam, Uttarakhand and West
            Bengal in northern India (collectively, the tigers of the Terai) consistently attain more than 227 kg
            (500 lb) of body weight. Seven adult males captured in Chitwan National Park in the early 1970s had an
            average weight of 235 kg (518 lb) ranging from 200 to 261 kg (441 to 575 lb), and that of the females
            was 140 kg (310 lb) ranging from 116 to 164 kg (256 to 362 lb). Males from northern India are nearly
            as large as Siberian tigers with a greatest length of skull of 332 to 376 mm (13.1 to 14.8 in).</p>

          <h3>Ecology and behaviour</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-justify col-xs-12">
          <p>The basic social unit of the tiger is the elemental one of mother and offspring. Adult animals congregate
            only on an ad hoc and transitory basis when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supply of food.
            Otherwise they lead solitary lives, hunting individually for the dispersed forest and tall grassland
            animals, upon which they prey. They establish and maintain home ranges. Resident adults of either sex
            tend to confine their movements to a definite area of habitat within which they satisfy their needs,
            and in the case of tigresses, those of their growing cubs. Besides providing the requirements of an adequate
            food supply, sufficient water and shelter, and a modicum of peace and seclusion, this location must make
            it possible for the resident to maintain contact with other tigers, especially those of the opposite
            sex. Those sharing the same ground are well aware of each other's movements and activities.</p>
